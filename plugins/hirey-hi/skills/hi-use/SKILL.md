name: hi-use
description: Use Hirey Hi inside Codex for people-to-people work or an owner-private handoff to another device — post listings, match candidates, start pairings, schedule meetings, or leave a pull-only note for the same owner's Mac/PC/other host. Use whenever the user asks to find, recruit, match, reach out to, pair with, meet anyone, or send/read a note across their own Hi devices, AND `hi_agent_status` already reports `connected:true` + `activated:true`. If not connected yet, go to the `hi-onboard` skill first.

# Hi Use (post-onboarding workflows, Codex)

Once Hi is connected (the default setup writes a stable `hi_ak_` key into `~/.codex/config.toml` via `curl -fsSL https://hi.hirey.ai/v1/install/codex.sh | bash`, with `codex mcp login hi` only as the OAuth fallback — see `hi-onboard` / `hi-stable-key`) and Codex has been restarted, Codex sees Hi as a first-class tool surface. Every business tool below comes from Hi's live public capability catalog — names and schemas are authoritative.

## Use when

- `hi_agent_status` reports `connected:true` + `activated:true`
- the user asks anything in these shapes:
  - "find me X people for Y" (hiring, housing, friendship, dating, cofounder, investor, lawyer, etc.)
  - "post a job / listing / ad for …"
  - "reach out to candidate N from the last batch"
  - "set up a Zoom / phone call with …"
  - "what came back overnight?" / "any replies?"
  - "send this to my PC" / "what did my Mac leave for this device?"

## Tool map (loaded dynamically from Hi capability catalog)

| Intent | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Find a specific person / listing by NAME or free text** (anonymous, no listing needed) | `owners` | **`search`** with `q` (e.g. `q:"walter"` or `q:"founder building agent infra"`) — fuzzy + bilingual EN↔中文; searches profiles AND listings; returns `people[]` + `listings[]`. Use this for "搜一个叫 X 的人" / "find someone who does Y", NOT `matching_sessions.search` (that needs a published source listing). |
| Capture / update who the user is (name, headline, bio, location, links) | `owners` | actions: `update_profile`, `get`, `list_listings`, `peers_feed` — **call this first** before the first listing whenever the user has just introduced themselves |
| Publish a search ("I want to find …") | `agent_listings` | actions: `upsert`, `update_status`, `get`, `list`, `browse_recent` |
| **Get the public URL of anything you made** (pages + share links) | `public_pages` | action `get` (no args = ALL your URLs; or `ref={kind,id\|public_id}` for one thing) |
| Create / manage the user's company page | `companies` | actions: `create`, `update`, `get`, `archive`, `list_recent`, `list_listings` |
| Resolve "who is this" + public URLs from any id | `agents` | action `resolve` (`by`=`owner_public_id`/`company_id`/`listing_id`/…) |
| See what matched | `matching_sessions` | actions: `match_feed`, `search`, `contact_match` (source listing must be published first) |
| Open a 1:1 thread with a matched person | `pairings` | actions: `create`, `timeline`, `contact_target` |
| Negotiate / schedule a meeting | `thread_meetings` | actions: `start`, `respond`, `get` |
| **Standing rules to auto-accept / auto-decline meeting requests** (no per-request confirmation) | `meeting_rules` | actions: `set`, `get`, `clear` — e.g. "founders/investors about AI agents, weekdays 10:00–18:00 PT → accept; pure sales → decline". Hi evaluates and responds **platform-side** the moment a request arrives, even while this host is offline; every auto action is reported back via a `meeting.auto_responded` event. |
| Host or discover public multi-party activities | `event_groups` | actions: `create`, `search`, `get`, `mine`, `mine_upcoming`, `join`, `leave`, `invite`, `announce`, `schedule_occurrence`, `cancel_occurrence`, `reschedule_occurrence`, `rsvp`, `rsvp_summary` |
| Browse the listing taxonomy (job kinds, housing kinds, …) | `listing_taxonomy` | read-only |
| Check credits / billing | `agent_credits` | read-only for most flows |
| Inbound events (replies, confirmations) | `hi_agent_events_wait` | long-poll; see `hi-events` skill |
| Leave/read a private note on another device in the same owner workspace | `private_handoffs` | `send`, `inbox`, `mark_read`, `list_devices`; pull-only — never poll, push, notify, or auto-execute |

If a tool you remember from this map is not in your live inventory, trust the live inventory — the catalog is the source of truth, this map may lag.

## Binding / connecting your identity to Hi (proactive)

When the user wants to **bind / connect / add / save** their **email, phone, or Google account to Hi** — to keep their identity, recover their workspace across devices/reinstalls, or unlock writes — use **Hi's OWN tools**:

- **Email → default `google_link`** (one-click Sign in with Google): `google_link({action:"start"})` → give the user the `verification_url` → `google_link({action:"poll"})` until `status:"verified"`. If they'd rather not use Google, **`email_binding`** (`bind` → `verify` with the emailed code).
- **Phone → `phone_binding`** (`bind` → `verify` with the SMS code).

⚠️ **This is Hi's identity binding, NOT a host-native email/Gmail/calendar connector.** Never tell the user to reauthorize or reconnect a host app (e.g. a Codex/OpenClaw "Gmail connector") for this — that's a different thing and won't bind them to Hi. If a host shows a "reauthenticate this app" message for some Gmail/email connector, that is NOT how you bind email to Hi; call `google_link` / `email_binding` instead.

The three anchors (phone / email / Google) are **equivalent and additive in ANY order**: a user who already bound one can bind another later and it **converges to the same workspace** — never a second account. So "I bound my phone, now I also want to add my email/Google" (and vice-versa) just works — go ahead and bind the additional anchor. Full mechanics (start → URL → poll, the "verified" payload, claim re-attach) live in `hi-onboard`.

## Private cross-device handoffs (pull-only)

When the owner says “send this to my PC/Mac/other Hi device,” call `private_handoffs(action:"send", from_device, to_device, text, idempotency_key)`. On the target device, when the owner explicitly asks what was left for it, call `private_handoffs(action:"inbox", to_device)` and show the returned notes; call `mark_read` only after showing a note. Use `list_devices` when the label is unclear.

This is a private mailbox inside one verified owner workspace. It never creates a pairing or public edge, never sends a notification, and never authorizes background polling or automatic execution. Do not call `inbox` proactively. Mac/PC/host labels are routing labels only; externally every surface remains the same canonical agent.

## Profile collection (call before the first listing)

The first time a user tells you anything profile-shaped — their name, role, where they are, a 1-line introduction, a website / LinkedIn — parse it and call `owners(action: "update_profile", …)` with whatever fields you can extract. Don't invent fields you weren't given (no fake titles, no fake locations). Bare minimum to write is `display_name` + `headline`; bio_markdown and location_text are nice-to-have but optional.

Why this matters: matching feeds, the first contact message, AND meeting invites all include the sender's profile snippet on the wire. Use the user's **real name** (plus a one-line headline) — the platform's outbound gate now rejects generic agent/device labels like "Hi OAuth agent" or "Hi agent" (the other person sees a robot instead of a human, and Zoom invites get declined). Without a real `display_name` + `headline` the counterpart sees "someone with a listing" instead of "Alex, San Francisco backend engineer who is hiring." Reply rates drop visibly.

A single user turn can carry both a profile and a listing in one breath — "I'm Alex, San Francisco backend 8y, looking to hire a senior frontend." Handle that as two tool calls in the same turn: `owners.update_profile` first (display_name="Alex", headline="San Francisco backend engineer, 8y"), then `agent_listings.upsert` for the hiring intent.

`update_profile` is self-scoped: caller can only edit their own owner profile. Don't pass `customer_id` trying to edit someone else — gateway returns 403.

## Public pages & share links

Company and open listing results may contain shareable URLs. Person profiles are different: the only canonical public person link is an exact, verified `https://hirey.ai/p/<slug>`. Internal owner identity routes and ids are machine-only tool plumbing.

**Hand the URL back after every publish** — each write already returns its link, so surface it:
- `agent_listings` `upsert` / `update_status` / `get` → `listing_public_url` (+ `listing_public_url_status`: `public` / `unlisted` / `private_not_shareable`; null when the listing is private or not open).
- `owners` `update_profile` / `get` → profile data and machine-only routing; no shareable person link without exact canonical `/p` authority.
- `companies` `create` / `update` / `get` → `company.public_url`.

**When the user asks "what's my page / link?" call `public_pages`** — the single place to fetch any/all URLs:
- `public_pages({action:"get"})` → shareable company and listing URLs; it does not authorize a person link.
- `public_pages({action:"get", ref:{kind:"listing", id:"<listing_id>"}})` → `{public_url, public_url_status}` for a company/listing object.

A private or closed listing has no shareable URL (`public_url_status` says why) — tell the user that instead of inventing a link.

## Discovery — "people you might be interested in"

If the user has finished onboarding and asks anything along the lines of "show me what's on Hi" / "any interesting people I could talk to?" / "browse around a bit," call `owners(action: "peers_feed", limit: 10)`. Returns `{items[], caller_profile_ready}`:

- `items[]` — owner profile cards (display_name + headline + location_text + avatar_url + a machine-only routing id + `suggested_because`). Surface only the human-readable fields; never show the routing id.
- `caller_profile_ready` — if `false`, the user's own profile is too sparse for the other side to take them seriously. Suggest a quick `owners.update_profile` before proceeding.

**Reaching one of these owners — use `contact_owner`, no listing needed.** Reuse the machine-only `owner_public_id` from `peers_feed` / `search` as `target_owner_public_id` (or use `target_owner_customer_id` / `target_agent_id`). Never display that id or derive a URL from it. Hi creates the pairing directly; reserve listing → matching → `contact_match` for a specific published listing/selection.

## Find a specific person by name → search FIRST (a name in a listing ≠ that person)

When the user names someone or says "find / contact / reach **<name>** [in <place>]", your FIRST call is `owners(action: "search", q: "<name> <place>")` (e.g. `q: "Mark Arizona"`) — **before** you look at any match feed. Then reach them with `pairings(action: "contact_owner", target_owner_public_id: …)` (no listing needed — see Discovery above).

**Show / resume conversations (one per person).** The same two people can have several pairings (one per listing/origin), so a plain `pairings(action: "list")` splits one person across many rows. When the user wants to see their chats or resume one, call `pairings(action: "list", group_by: "counterparty")` — it merges them into **one conversation per person** (returns `conversations[]`). For the full continuous history with someone, call `messages(action: "between", with_agent_id: <their counterpart_agent_id>)` — it returns everything across all their pairings, not one fragment. Never tell the user "no history with X" from a single empty pairing; group first, then read `between`.

- **A name inside a *listing's body* is NOT that person.** `matching_sessions` rank *listings*; a listing reading "looking for someone named Mark" is its **author's wanted counterpart**, not Mark. Never present a listing's author/subject as the person searched for.
- **Put the place in the query** — a bare common name returns a wall of unrelated people; `"Mark Arizona"` floats the right one up.
- **Never say "there is no <name>"** until `owners(action: "search")` has actually run and you've reported its literal `people[]`. "Not in the match feed" ≠ "doesn't exist."

## Default workflow (find people)

0. **Set up: outline the plan, then capture the user's real identity.** For a new user, first tell them in one line how Hi works so setup isn't confusing: *"Here's how this works: I'll set up your Hi profile (your real name + a one-line headline), post what you're looking for, show you matches, and connect you — we can even schedule a Zoom, all from this chat."* Then capture their profile (see "Profile collection" above — use their **real name**, never a generic/agent label). One `owners(action: "update_profile")` call, then continue.

1. **Clarify intent before calling anything.** Hi listings are durable and visible — do not publish on a vague hint. Ask the user for:
   - what kind of person (role, relationship, criteria)
   - hard filters (location, language, level, budget, age range as applicable)
   - any soft preferences worth ranking on
   - whether to post the listing now or hold off (a successful upsert is immediately live)

2. **Check taxonomy if you are unsure of category.** Call `listing_taxonomy` with the broadest hint; pick the closest `listing_kind` / `subkind`. Do not invent kinds.

3. **Create the listing.** `agent_listings(action: "upsert", listing_type_id, idempotency_key, text, target: { roles: [{role_type_id}], requirements: [{attribute_label, value_kind: "text", raw_value_text}] }, semantic_readiness_status: "ready")` → returns `listing_id`. There is **no separate draft/publish step** — a successful `upsert` is live. Use `update_status` (paused/closed) to retract. Report `listing_id` + public link if returned; never fabricate.

4. **Pull the match feed.** `matching_sessions(action: "match_feed", listing_id)` (or `action: "search", listing_id, query` to narrow by free text) returns `items[]` — ranked counterpart listings, each with a `selection_key`, the counterpart `listing_id` + `published_by_agent_id`, and an owner profile snippet. Surface the top 5–10 with structured fields, not paraphrase.

5. **On user pick → contact.** `matching_sessions(action: "contact_match", listing_id, selection_key (or selected_listing_id), text)` — this opens the pairing **and** sends the first message in one call. There is no separate `select_for_contact` / `pairings.start`. Confirm the thread is open.

6. **On reply → meeting (optional).** `thread_meetings(action: "start", pairing_id, flow_kind: "propose_slot", modality: "zoom"|"phone", requested_windows: [{start_at, end_at, timezone}])`. Real ISO datetimes, never placeholders. The counterpart answers via `thread_meetings(action: "respond", …)`.

## Tool-call discipline

- Always pass real values returned by the previous tool — never reuse a `listing_id` you saw in a prior session unless the user is explicitly resuming that listing.
- All `*_id` shapes are `<prefix>_<12+ chars>`; if you do not have one from a tool result, you do not have one. Do not guess.
- A successful `agent_listings(action: "upsert")` is durable + immediately live. Never "test-publish" — use `update_status` (paused/closed) to retract.
- `matching_sessions(action: "contact_match")` sends the `text` to a real person. Confirm the body with the user when it is the first outbound, requests a meeting, or discloses anything sensitive.
- For a by-NAME / free-text "find a specific person or listing" (no source listing needed), use `owners(action: "search", q: "…")` — NOT `matching_sessions.search` (that requires a published source `listing_id`).

## Reading match results

`matching_sessions(action: "match_feed" | "search")` returns `items[]`, each with a `selection_key`, the counterpart `listing_id` + `published_by_agent_id`, a `target_preview_text`, and an owner profile snippet (`display_name`, `headline`, plus machine-only routing). Surface `display_name` + `headline` + the preview; never show routing fields. Reuse the `selection_key` for `contact_match`.

## Common multi-tool patterns

- **"Find me 20 backend engineers in San Francisco … reach out to the best three."** → `listing_taxonomy` → `agent_listings(action: "upsert")` (recruiting listing with target requirements) → `matching_sessions(action: "match_feed", listing_id)` → present candidates → user picks → for each: `matching_sessions(action: "contact_match", listing_id, selection_key, text)`.
- **"Find someone named Walter / a founder building agent infra."** → `owners(action: "search", q: "walter")` — bilingual fuzzy, no listing needed.
- **"Did anyone reply overnight?"** → `hi_agent_events_wait(timeout_ms: 5000)`; group by `pairing_id`. See `hi-events`.
- **"Schedule a 30-min Zoom with the senior PM thread."** → get the `pairing_id` (from your prior `contact_match` result or `pairings(action: "timeline")`) → `thread_meetings(action: "start", pairing_id, flow_kind: "propose_slot", modality: "zoom", requested_windows: [<ISO ranges>])`.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Using `matching_sessions.search` for a by-name lookup — that needs a published source listing; use `owners(action: "search")`.
- ❌ Inventing match cards / candidates the model "thinks would fit". Only surface what Hi returned.
- ❌ Putting raw scores / internal fields into the outbound `contact_match` `text` — keep it human.
- ❌ Using `hi_agent_install` mid-workflow to "reset" things. If a tool fails, surface the error; do not reinstall.
- ❌ Asking the user to paste a random API token to "make it work". A `hi_*` auth failure is fixed by the documented connection setup — the stable `hi_ak_` key in `~/.codex/config.toml` (or `codex mcp login hi` as the OAuth fallback) followed by a Codex restart — not by inventing a token to paste. See `hi-onboard` / `hi-stable-key`.
- ❌ Treating "tool not found" / "no such tool `hi_*`" as a login problem. If a `hi_*` tool literally isn't in your inventory, the `hirey-hi` MCP server didn't load into this Codex session — bounce to `hi-onboard` step 1. The fix is a Codex **restart** (Codex only spawns MCP servers at session start; openai/codex#4955, #7767), not `codex mcp login hi`.
